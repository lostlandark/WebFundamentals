Building multi-screen experiences is not as hard as it sounds. By following
the lessons in this guide, we will build an example product landing page for our
[CS256 Mobile Web Development course](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs256)
that works well across all different device types.

## Final product

After you've completed the above lessons, you will have produced an excellent product landing
page that you could use on your own sites.  It will be responsive across
mobile all the way up to TV.
