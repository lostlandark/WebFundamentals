Most of your interactions with the Google Web Starter Kit will be

# Install prerequisites

Before installing the Google Web Starter Kit,
you will need the following:

* NodeJS v?
* npm v?(which comes bundles with Node)

You can check if you have Node and npm installed by typing:

$ node --version && npm --version

If you are using the kit tooling,
install the dependencies needed:

npm install

# Clone repository

You can use Web Starter Kit just by cloning the repository and buildingon what we include in the `app` directory:

git clone git://github.com/yeoman/web-starter-kit.git

# Choose starting point

You will want to checkout `index.html` (the default starting point, slide-out menu),'alt-layout.html' (if you prefer a horizontal nav) or `basic.html` (no layout).

#Install tooling dependencies

If you are using the optional tooling,
install the dependencies needed:

npm install

If you see permission or access errors,
prepend sudo to the above command:

sudo npm install

# Build the project

Build the current project:

gulp

# Review the build output

Open up the 'blah' directory and take a look at your project files:

TBD.

TODO: Can you open index.html or basic.html in local staged version?
TODO: How do the project files differ based on path taken (index, basic,
and/or tooling install)?
